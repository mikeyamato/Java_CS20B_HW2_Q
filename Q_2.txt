Q. True or False? Explain your answers.

(a) (1 point) You can define constructors for a Java interface.
(b) (1 point) Classes implement interfaces.
(c) (1 point) Classes extend interfaces.
(d) (1 point) A class that implements an interface can include methods
that are not required by the interface.
(e) (1 point) A class that implements an interface can leave out methods
that are required by an interface
(f) (1 point) You can instantiate objects of an interface.


A.

(a) False. Interface
(b) True. public class Example<T> implements IExample<T>
(c) False. classes can extend classes or interfaces can extend interfaces. But classes do not extend interfaces...only inherit.
(d) False. Every method needs to be used in an interface.
(e) True. This is where the calling class adds any missing methods not found in the interface.
(f) False. Canâ€™t create and instance of the interface but a reference of it that refers to the Object of its implementing class can be made.
